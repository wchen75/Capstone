Overview
--------

This R Markdown presentation is made interactive using Shiny for the
final course project: Data Science Capstone. The goal of this exercise
is to create a product to highlight the algorithm to do the next word
prediction.

The Shiny application has been deployed on Rstudio's servers. Rstudio
Presenter has been used to create this presentation.

Process and Algorithm
---------------------

This application will be using 3 datasets from the blogs text, news
articles and tweets. These datasets then are processed by Data Sampling,
Data Cleaning, exploratory analysis, and the prediction model building.

Frequency dictionary was created used to predict the next words comes
from a corpus.
